# SMS_Classifier

Overview
This project aims to create an Email Spam Classifier using Python and Streamlit.

The classifier is built on a dataset obtained from Kaggle, and the entire process is organized into distinct stages such as data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), text preprocessing, model building, evaluation, improvement, and deployment.

**Project Structure**

Data Cleaning:

In this stage, we address any inconsistencies or missing values in the dataset to ensure high-quality input for the subsequent steps.

EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis):

A comprehensive exploration of the dataset is performed to gain insights into the characteristics of spam and non-spam emails. Visualizations and statistical analyses are used to understand the data.

Text Preprocessing:

The textual content of the emails is processed to extract relevant features. Techniques such as tokenization, stemming, and removing stop words are applied to prepare the data for model training.

Model Building:

Various machine learning models are trained using the preprocessed data to classify emails as spam or non-spam. The performance of each model is evaluated to choose the most effective one.

Evaluation:

The performance metrics of the chosen model are presented, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. This section provides an understanding of how well the classifier performs on the given dataset.

Improvement:

Strategies for enhancing the model's performance are explored. This may include tuning hyperparameters, experimenting with different models, or incorporating additional features.

Website:

A Streamlit-based web application is developed to provide a user-friendly interface for interacting with the trained spam classifier. Users can input an email, and the model will predict whether it is spam or not.

Deployment:

Details on how to deploy the model and the Streamlit web application are provided. This includes any necessary dependencies, configuration steps, and hosting considerations.
